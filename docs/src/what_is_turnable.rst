What is Turnable?
=================

Turnable is a micro-framework that allows developers to make syncronized turn-based games.
Turnable comes with helper classes to easily develop your own CLI game, but you can use it to build any kind
of game, like web or GUI.

.. note::
    See :ref:`projects` for a list of games built with Turnable.
